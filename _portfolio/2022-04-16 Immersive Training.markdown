Immersive Training is a collection of three separate products

## Objections Handling 

> 

## Elevator pitch

> Emozionella created a VR simulation to allow business people to test their elevator pitch. A virtual character (Markus Adams) has been created to interact with the player like a real person in an elevator. The app is part of Noema Immersive training and it is fully customizable. At the end it provides a score based on how time was used during the interaction with the virtual character.
