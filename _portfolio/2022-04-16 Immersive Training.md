Immersive Training is a collection of three separate products

## Objections Handling

> Noema HR Emozionella has developed a business training application named "Objections Handling" specifically tailored to meet the needs of professionals. This innovative app takes users on an exhilarating journey through space, where they navigate a wormhole in a small spacecraft. The objective of the game is to succeed in a high-speed race by swiftly selecting the correct responses to various sales objections presented to the player. Multiple rounds and moments of relaxation provide the user with breathtaking space scenery, enhancing their overall experience. The culmination of the game is marked by an arrival chart.
> 
> The creators meticulously crafted the environment to accurately simulate the emotional context of encountering objections. The app boasts full configurability and functions independently, allowing users to tailor their training experience according to their specific requirements. From an experiential standpoint, the app incorporates elements reminiscent of classic arcade games, engaging users physically and mentally. This pioneering solution empowers both companies and trainers to easily and efficiently teach soft skills using virtual realityâ€”a groundbreaking achievement in the field.

## Sales Argumentations

> Noema HR Emozionella has developed a business training app called "Sales Argumentations" for an immersive and engaging learning experience. In this app, the player is transported to a Deepspace base cargo hall where they are assigned a mission: to identify and select the benefits that arise from the featured product based on the target audience.
> 
> The main cargo hall houses the "feature" at its center, while the benefits are depicted as floating spheres dispersed throughout the air around the player. By aiming and shooting at these spheres, the player can choose the appropriate benefits. The tasks must be completed within a specific time frame, and there are multiple levels of complexity to challenge the player. A scoreboard presents the points earned at the end of the exercise.
> 
> The environment of the app is designed to encourage full-body engagement and stimulate the user's exploration and discovery process. This process mirrors the customization of a sales conversation during a meeting. The app offers full configurability and can function as a standalone tool.
> 
> From an experiential standpoint, the app provides a gaming-like atmosphere reminiscent of an arcade game. It requires the active involvement of the entire body to enhance the learning process. For the first time, companies and trainers have the opportunity to teach soft skills using virtual reality in an easy and efficient manner.

## Elevator Pitch

> For Noema HR, Emozionella has developed a remarkable business training application named "Elevator Pitch." 
> 
> This innovative app offers users the opportunity to put their elevator pitch to the test in an authentic elevator environment. To enhance the realism of the experience, a virtual character named Markus Adams has been meticulously crafted to engage with the player just like a genuine individual would in an elevator setting. Moreover, the app offers extensive customization options, allowing users to tailor their experience to their specific needs.
> 
> The journey begins with the user attending a company workshop held at the prestigious 'Success Tower Convention Center' in Chicago. The primary objective of this workshop is to persuade Markus Adams to consider a partnership opportunity. Throughout the interaction, users engage in dynamic conversations with Markus, leveraging their elevator pitch skills to captivate his interest and secure his potential partnership.
> 
> Upon reaching the culmination of the experience, users find themselves atop the rooftops, where they are presented with a comprehensive score board. This score board evaluates how effectively users utilized their time during the interaction with the virtual character. It serves as a valuable metric to assess their performance and offers insights into areas for improvement.
> 
> With the "Elevator Pitch" app, Noema HR and Emozionella have combined cutting-edge technology and immersive storytelling to create a powerful training tool that enhances users' business communication skills. By simulating real-world scenarios within the confines of an elevator, this app provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for individuals to refine their pitch and achieve professional success.
