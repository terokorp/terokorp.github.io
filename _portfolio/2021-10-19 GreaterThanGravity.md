GreaterThanGravity (GTG) is one weekend "gamejam" hobby project. Inspired by [Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_(1996_video_game)) by Miika Virpioja
Game itself is my first 2D game and main purpose was just to test how to make 2D games with Unity.

## Gameplay ##

Game is basicly racing game against clock. Timer starts on start line and when player has went thru all checkpoints and goes over finish line then timer stops.
Game is still work in progress so it dosen't save times or have main menu.
