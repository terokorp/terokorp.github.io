> For Noema HR, Emozionella created a platform to deliver mental empowering experiences to VR META Quest 2 device. 
> The project is made of 3 parts: the platform, the client app and the content.
> (1) The platform to deliver experiences to VR devices (like a Netflix of VR mental empowering experiences). Create reports and manage security
> (2) The client app to allow users to browse and select content 
> (2) The content: a full library of VR experiences immediately ready, grouped by empowering goals (emotional cleansing, power, focus, resilience and more). New experiences are being produced every month. 
> 
> MPOWERâ€™s VR experiences are fully immersive and engaging.
